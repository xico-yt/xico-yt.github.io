* Lab 4 part 2:

    The Hi-Lo Guessing Game in lab 4 part 2 was my favorite lab to code with my partner because of the game aspect to the code.The printing part of the guesses being either wrong or right, or too high or too low for the first guess was fun to code. It was fun seeing the code actually function as it was supposed to as we weren't particularly struggling with the code but it wasn't a light breeze either, it was the first code we had done that had a prompt if you guessed it right or did not, meaning any answer would still give a prompt, which it was fun to code a backup plan.


* Lab 6 part 2:

    The blackjack game code in lab 6 part 2 was my favorite lab for me because I had played blackjack as a kid but I had the opportunity to code the game myself which was fun. Getting to code the if statement for the Ace using the ability to be 11 points or 1 point was fun due to it being a sort of challenge.The letter cards were also fun to code as they are not a numerical value but all have the value of 10, which was interesting coding words into a numerical value.


* Lab 7:

    The lab 7 parking signs was my favorite lab to code with my partner because me and my partner had known what to do, took the equal turns coding and struggled a bit but were able to overcome the challenges. It was fun to code the if statements or the if-else statements because of the dates and times for the parking zones. At one point we had a TA walk around and he saw our code, pointed it out how it was good then helped us as we were struggling with putting the functions to days, which was confusing as they had days in the function, making it very confusing. But the TA helped us and it was a very fun part of getting help but also getting acknowledged for having good code at the same time.
